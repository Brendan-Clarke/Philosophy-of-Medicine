#Chapter 3: causation in medicine

##Introduction
This section of the module is grounded in a puzzle about a remarkable difference between our intuitions and our theories. Our intuition tells us that we live in an intensely causal world. When we operate a light-switch, we really believe that our intervention has caused the light in our room to switch on. Or when we experience a racing pulse after consuming a surfeit of coffee, we believe that the caffeine we have taken has caused this to happen. And in a great many particular cases, we successfully use causes to achieve desirable ends (preventing diseases by vaccination, for example, or resolving disputes about liabilities for an accident). We believe in causes utterly.

What's more, we believe that causes are special. In the cases above, we think that the kind of relationship that exists between flicking a switch and the lighting up of a bulb is decidedly non-accidental. Similarly, it is no coincidence that our heart rate rockets shortly after we drink our coffee. Something special happens when we flick the switch, or sink the drink, that is responsible for bringing about illumination or tachycardia. And it is the special nature of this relationship that makes causes so special. We assume that, if we really are dealing with a causal relationship, that this kind of connection between cause and effect can be exploited to perform useful (or, at least, interesting) work for us. So we might like to use our knowledge of causes to make predictions ("*The light will come on when I press the switch*"). Or we might try to use our causal knowledge to explain a phenomenon of interest ("*My heart was racing because of the coffee I drank before the lecture*"). Or, most importantly of all, we might exploit a causal relationship to intervene in the world ("*Let me just switch the light on...*").

However...

It seems extremely hard to give an account of what this causation actually is. Remarkably hard, in fact, to pin down any properties of this most basic feature of the world as we perceive it. This hardness extends right across the spectrum of enquiry, from the most practical (trying to show that a drug has a particular effect, for example), to the most abstract and philosophical (trying to give an account of the metaphysics of causation).

We will examine this quandary over the next three weeks in several different ways. We'll begin (in this lecture note) by looking at some of the different tools that have been used to understand causation in medicine. This is a good place to start because of the existence of a number of conceptual schemes that are capable – in certain practical contexts - of side-stepping some of the difficulties that have plagued philosophical theories of causation. In the next session, we'll begin thinking more philosophically, by thinking about Hume's account of causation. Here, the overriding claim is one of extreme scepticism. Hume's conclusion, very approximately, is that causation is not something that exists in the world at all, and is instead just a psychological trick on our part. While extremely influential, this view is not one that we can easily accept if we are interested in using causes for our own advantage (in medical practice, say). Happily, not all philosophers have been as sceptical as Hume about the possibility of achieving some kind of meaningful understanding of causation, and we will examine some of these accounts of causation in following sessions. Finally, at the end of this section of the module, we will think about a question that arises when we look at all the different ways that doctors and philosophers have sought to understand causes. Given that there are many different ways of understanding causation, each with characteristic advantages and disadvantages, is there some way that we can improve our causal thinking by becoming pluralist about causation?

In this lecture note, we will begin in a fairly safe place. Given all the difficulties of thinking about causation, it seems remarkable that so much of modern medicine depends on knowing about, and exploiting, causal knowledge. Much of this understanding has come about from a group of methods specifically developed to understand causation in medicine. It's these that we'll discuss this week.

This lecture note chapter aims to:

1.	Introduce the concept of causality
2.	To introduce some of the models of causality that have been important in modern medicine (particularly, Koch’s postulates and the Hill criteria)
3.	To set the scene for the next lecture, which will introduce a more philosophical treatment of some of the issues raised here

##Medical schemes of cause

We'll begin with an undefended assertion: finding causes and using them is a useful strategy in medical practice. Given this assertion (which we will later return to examine in a more critical frame of mind), how have the problems of causality been with dealt with in scientific practice? The first important thing to note here is that the predominant way of understanding causation in medicine has changed several times in the last 150 years or so. In fact, causal thinking in medicine has undergone two major revolutions, as well as a host of more minor transformations, since the late nineteenth century. 

For our purposes, the beginnings of contemporary causal reasoning in medicine dates from about 1880, and arose as a part of Robert Koch's research into the causes of tuberculosis. The word causes here gives a useful clue to the tenor of causal thinking in scientific medicine prior to this date. In general, the kind of causal thinking that prevailed was one of extreme *multicausality*, meaning that many different factors were thought to participate in bringing about a particular disease. To illustrate, let's have a look at some causal thinking in practice from 1845:

>...in his account of diabetes, Bardsley identified the following causes: frequent exposure to sudden alterations of heat and cold, indulgences in copious draughts of cold fluid when the system has been over-heated by labor or exercise, intemperate use of spirituous liquors, poor living, sleeping out the whole of the night in the open air in a state of intoxication, checking perspiration suddenly, and mental anxiety and distress...similar lists can be found for virtually any disease in most German, English, or French medical texts from the period.
(Carter 2003: 11) 

Note that, first of all, there is no one cause of diabetes. Instead, the general model here is one of interacting causes that collectively lead to the production of the disease. Note too that these contributing factors are rather generic in kind. So these causes of diabetes could also play a role in bringing about many other diseases also. Uncoincidentally, these causes often concerned immoral behaviours of one kind or another, with factors like drunkenness, poor housing, sexual promiscuity, or over- and under-eating very frequently causally implicated. A third feature of the general picture of causation in this period that is not evident from the quote is that diseases were usually described and defined in terms of their clinical features. This has some important implications for thinking about disease causation in this period. As the symptoms and signs of a disease were understood to define its essence, the causes of disease assumed a subsidiary importance in accounts of that disease, with the description of symptoms (and pathology, particularly in the second half of the nineteenth century) being the main object of study. It also meant that diseases were classified primarily on the basis of these symptoms. As ideas about causation in medicine changed, so would ideas about classification too. We will discuss this link between classification and causation later. 

Without getting excessively bogged down in the historical details, this multicausal model was upset by the development of the germ theory of disease in general, and the discovery of the aetiology of tuberculosis in particular (for details on germ theories, Worboys 2000 is the standard source, while for the transition in causal thinking in medicine in general in this period see Carter 2003). Koch's discovery of the causal role of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* was accompanied by a novel understanding of causation in medicine, which introduced a new concept to the field: that causes should be necessary and sufficient to bring about their effects. This altered (theoretical) concept of causality was accompanied by a new method for understanding causes in practice: Koch's postulates. Let's deal with these postulates first.

##Koch's postulates
Koch's practical innovation was to produce a set of instructions for discovering if a bacterial agent causes a disease:

>To prove that tuberculosis is caused by the invasion of bacilli, and that it is a parasitic disease primarily caused by the growth and multiplication of bacilli, it is necessary to isolate the bacteria from the body, to grow them in pure culture until they are freed from every disease product of the animal organism, and, by introducing isolated bacilli into animals, to reproduce the same morbid condition that is known to follow from inoculation with spontaneously developed tuberculous material.
(Carter 1987: 87, translation of Koch 1882)
 
This was a revolutionary idea, in that it promised a very easy method of determining whether or not a particular bacterial agent was the cause of a particular idea (think in terms of the concept of *positivism* that we discussed in lecture one). Given a causal candidate – a bacterium isolated from an individual with a particular disease – the inferential steps are simple. Isolate the bacterium, grow it in culture, and see if the cultured agent causes similar disease when transmitted to an experimental animal. Easy!

However, the discovery of a particular method that could be used to understand causes was not the most important consequence of this argument. Even more radically, the very concept of cause implied by the postulates was fundamentally different from those that had come before in medicine. 

##Monocausality
Remember that I used the term *multicausal* to describe causal thinking in medicine pre-Koch. The idea was that many factors could be causally responsible for the development of a disease. However, the model of causation implied by Koch's writings is fundamentally different, in that it is a *monocausal* model of causation, in which only one factor is held to be the cause of a disease. In the case of tuberculosis, for which Koch's postulates were developed, this monocausal thinking meant that infection with the bacteria *M. tuberculosis* was capable of bringing about the disease tuberculosis. In other words, we can say that *M. tuberculosis* became a *sufficient* cause of tuberculosis. It is worth exploring this claim more thoroughly:
 
###Sufficient cause: one capable of bringing an effect about by acting alone (each C brings about an E)

If the procedure outlined in the postulates is followed correctly and successfully, the result is to show that a particular C (*M. tuberculosis*) will bring about a particular E (tuberculosis), even in the absence of other causal factors. Hence we know that our C is a sufficient cause of our E. Note though that the method described here doesn't necessarily tell the user all they would like to know about the causal relation that obtains between the bacterium and the disease. Another very important aspect – that of *necessity* – is missing.

###Necessary cause: one which is required to bring about an effect (no C means no E)

To illustrate, consider the case where several different bacteria are each sufficient causes of a disease – food poisoning or pneumonia might be good practical examples. Here, you could satisfy Koch's postulates perfectly for each C, thus showing that each are sufficient causes, yet would be unable to say anything about their necessity. Conversely, cases might exist where two different bacteria are jointly required to bring about a disease (swine influenza, thought to be caused by co-infection with a virus and a bacterium, is one historical example mentioned by Evans (1976: 178), although note that the disease is now thought to be caused by a virus alone). In this kind of case, neither alone will satisfy the postulates, yet both will be necessary causes of the disease. It is very useful to have identified necessary and sufficient causes (for reasons that we'll discuss later), but note that 'real' causes may be neither necessary, nor sufficient (e.g. Mackie 1974: INUS conditions). Koch's postulates tell the user about sufficiency, but determining necessity requires a further procedure is necessary.

##The ætiological standpoint
In the aftermath of Koch's publications on tuberculosis, infectious diseases became defined in terms of their cause, rather than – as previously – their symptoms.[^aetiolo]   In this case, the disease tuberculosis was redefined in terms of infection with *M. tuberculosis*, rather than (as previously) on the grounds of its clinical features. This has two extremely important implications. First, it makes *M. tuberculosis* both a necessary (by reclassification) and sufficient (by Koch's postulates) cause of tuberculosis. Any infection with *M. tuberculosis* becomes, by definition, a case of tuberculosis. Second, it had the effect of unifying a variety of previously unconnected disease. These included phthisis and consumption (which became reclassified as forms of pulmonary tuberculosis), scrofula (tuberculosis of the lymph nodes in the neck), Pott's disease (becoming tuberculosis of the spine), as well as some forms of meningitis. From this group of – symptomatically unconnected – diseases emerged a single overarching classification – tuberculosis – divided into different manifestations.

This kind of reclassification had profound implications for the way that causes were understood in medicine, largely because changing disease classification changes the evidence available for causal inference.  To briefly expand on that, consider correlation. *Correlations* – which we can define as any statistical dependence between a pair of variables – are very important evidence for causation. While, as *any fule kno*, correlation does not imply causation, many ways of understanding causes do use correlations as part of their evidence for inferring the existence of causal relationships. After all, if causal relationships really are special in the ways that we identified at the start of this lecture, we should expect them to generate strong correlations as a matter of course. So the operation of the light switch correlates with the illumination of the bulb, and it does so because one causes the other. Similarly, increased heart rate correlates with coffee consumption just because of the causal relationship. If we're looking to discover a causal relationship, then, looking for strong and persistent correlations is a good place to start. However (and here's the important bit), these correlations depend on classification. If we change the way that we classify a disease, then we may change the apparent correlations that could be used as a basis for causal inference. 

##Shortcomings of Koch's postulates
The most immediate effect of Koch's work was to cause an explosion of research into the causes of other diseases that followed Koch's method. However, in this early period, a number of diseases proved resistant to analysis in this way (Historians! Avert your eyes – dreadfully presentist way of thinking ahead). Some of this resistance was due to the 'real' cause of the disease being non-bacterial (so explaining the failure experienced in cancer research that looked for bacteria causes), but in other cases – that appeared to be genuinely bacterial – difficulties were experienced that appeared to result from shortcomings of Koch's method. In the tutorial, we will discuss some of the modifications made to Koch's postulates to attempt to overcome some of these difficulties (particularly those thrown up by causal inference in viral diseases, such as Rivers 1937 and Huebner 1957). For now, though, I'll just give an overview of a few problems, as originally suggested by Evans (1976).

###Some bacteria could not grow in pure culture
Koch's *pure culture* has a very specific meaning: axenic, or acellular, growth media. Many bacteria will not grow in such media. One example: *Mycobacterium leprae*, which is thought to cause leprosy, will not grow *in vitro* at all (it is an obligate intracellular parasite, and laboratory culture is now possible only in whole-animal systems). So does *M. leprae* cause leprosy? Another example of this – and one that would prompt several attempts to reformulate Koch's postulates such that pure culture was not required - were viral diseases.

###Some diseases could not be induced in experimental animals
Cholera is a good historical example of this. Koch discovered *Vibrio cholera*, but no model system in which the organism could be induced was available. This meant that – although *V. cholera* could be isolated from individuals with cholera, and could be cultured in pure culture - it was not possible to satisfy the final part of the process as no other animal seemed to suffer from similar symptoms to those of humans when inoculated. 

###Some diseases have carrier states or asymptomatic infections
An example of this is typhoid, which can notoriously persist for years in apparently healthy individuals (see the lurid details of [typhoid Mary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoid_Mary)). This kind of state, where an organism can be isolated from an individual apparently not suffering any disease, causes difficulties concerning sufficiency. Remembering that our definition of sufficiency is:

**Sufficient cause:** one capable of bringing an effect about by acting alone (each *C* brings about an *E*)

So finding an organism at play in someone without the disease suggests that the organism is not actually sufficient. Bad news!

###Some diseases result from infection with many agents 
As discussed above, cases where multiple infectious agents are required to produce a disease present difficulties for Koch's model, because neither component alone will satisfy the postulates. Evans (1976) presents an example of swine fever, where apparently co-infection with a virus and a bacterium are required to bring the disease about. 

###What to do with other kinds of evidence? (immunological or epidemiological, e.g.)
As we discussed when we were talking about Burkitt lymphoma, a whole range of different kinds of evidence were used to substantiate the causal claim, including pathological, epidemiological, and immunological evidences. Given that these kinds of evidence seem to be useful in discovering causal relationships, how can we understand their role in this process if fulfilling Koch's postulates is all that is 'actually' required?
The Hill criteria
These problems with Koch's postulates were initially regarded as unusual exceptions to good rule. However, interest grew in understanding the causation of non-bacterial diseases during the early twentieth century, in part because of the successes of the Koch-mediated improvements in understanding bacterial diseases, and in part because of the increasing importance assumed by chronic (=long-term), non-infectious diseases (CNIDs) in medicine in the later twentieth century. But the key question was this: how to use this kind of methodology under conditions where the letter of Koch's postulates could not be followed? What other methods are the analogues of isolating, culturing, and transfecting, in cases where the suspected aetiological agent is non-bacterial?[^hkp-mods]  

One answer to this kind of puzzle was provided by Sir Austin Bradford Hill (Hill 1965). Instead of basing causal inference in a particular set of methods, the Hill criteria were proposed as a set of features often found in genuinely causal relationships. The nine criteria are:

- Strength (roughly equivalent to the relative risk) 
- Consistency 
- Specificity
- Temporality
- Biological gradient (dose-response relationship)
- Plausibility
- Coherence
- Experiment
- Analogy

Note that none of these are necessary or sufficient for causation. The evidence relating to a genuinely causal relationship may lack one or more criteria, while criteria may easily be demonstrated in non-causal correlations. Hill certainly did not intend these features to be used as a tick-list demonstrating causation, or anything like it. Nor is much guidance given about how they should be investigated (i.e. which methods work well to show a robust relationship) or interpreted (i.e. how the presence of a particular criterion might suggest that a relationship is actually causal). In fact, even understanding what some of the criteria really mean can be tricky – like the difference between analogy and plausibility. As well as the criteria, Hill's short paper makes a number of other suggestions regarding how to improve causal inference (usefully reviewed in Philips and Goodman 2004), which are worth briefly relating here.

- Statistical significance should not be mistaken for evidence of a substantial association
- Association does not prove causation
- Precision should not be mistaken for validity
- Evidence (or belief) that there is a causal relationship is not sufficient to suggest action should be taken.
- Uncertainty about whether there is a causal relationship (or even an association) is not sufficient to suggest action should not be taken. 

What should you take away from this summary? That Hill's causal thinking was very profoundly different from Koch's, in at least two respects. First, the criteria describe features of evidence, rather than a set of methods for understanding causes. This means that – while the Hill criteria can more easily be applied to a range of different types of causal relationship, and not just the bacteriological realm – they require very much more interpretation to apply. Second, and something that perhaps is not obvious from reading the criteria alone, is that Hill's interpretation of causality was *multifactorial*. This move, from monocausality to multifactorial causal thinking, is the second great transformation in causal thinking that I mentioned in the introduction. The general idea is that a disease may be caused by several different causal factors, usually without any being essential. This idea, while widely discussed for most of the first half of the twentieth century in the epidemiological literature, really rose to widespread acceptance in the aftermath of the struggles to demonstrate a causal role for smoking in carcinoma of the lung, and the (very widely circulated) report on this topic by the US Surgeon General (Surgeon General 1964). You can also find many other examples of such multifactorial causal schemes (Dorn 1953; Hammond 1955; Yerushalmy and Palmer 1959; Sartwell 1960; Wynder 1966; Yerushalmy 1966 and Cassel 1976), although Hill was, and remains, by far the most widely cited and applied.

##Footnotes

[^aetiolo]: This is historical butchery of the worst kind. Actually, the beginnings of the academic position that Carter calls the etiological standpoint can be traced back to a group of biomedical research projects between 1830-1860 that looked to find causes for a variety of different conditions, and to the gradual development of germ theories of disease during the 1870s and 1880s. However, as a revolution in medical practice (as opposed to theory), the aetiological standpoint was really most active during the late 1880s and 1890s, mainly because of the tuberculosis case. My impression is that the importance of this single reclassification (remember, something like 10% of all deaths that have ever occurred have been caused by tuberculosis) is mainly responsible for transforming the academic project of reclassification into one that changed the daily practice of medicine.
