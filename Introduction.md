#Methods in medicine: an introduction to the philosophy of medicine

This needs a pre-amble, which will go something like:
- what is this book about? **An accessible introduction to practically-engaged philosophy of medical sciences** (Defining philosophy of medicine and the Arthur Caplan problem)
- what is this book not about? **ethics, medical humanities.**
- who is it for? **linking text - for medics interested in philosophy, or for philosophers interested in medicine**
- who might it not be for? **experts looking for a comprehensive monograph, or state-of-the-art snapshot**

## 8 cases, 8 tools
This book is organised into 8 chapters. Each begins with a short summary of some interesting aspect of medical practice - either a brief historical case, an account of a contemporary method, or a description of a dilemma facing patients and practitioners. Each chapter then introduces a philosophical tool as a way of understanding some of the the matters raised in the medical case. These are:

### Chapter 1: Chronic fatigue syndrome and definitions of disease
**Case: Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)**
CFS is a condition of uncertain status. While widely diagnosed, the condition is poorly understood. That is, sadly, not unusual - many diseases are less well understood than we might like. What is very unusual is just how differently CFS is understood in different contexts. Broadly, different concepts of the disease are typically found in general medicine, in psychiatry, and in patient support groups. This has led to a remarkable number of disputes between the stakeholders, with the most striking of these disputes being about the very existence of the condition.Other, perhaps less dramatic discussions include those regarding the most appropriate terminology to use to describe it, the cause(s) of the condition, the kinds of pathological processes involved, the most appropriate management strategies, including means of diagnosis. This case-study presents a taxonomy of some of these disputes by use of a philosophical tool: definitions of disease.

**Tool: Definitions of disease**
Every discipline has a few classic questions. For philosophy of medicine, it would be that of the definition of a disease. It has certainly been the most frequent topic of publications. This section picks out some of the themes from this extensive (and often esoteric) literature, with the intention of showing how disease might be defined. Broadly, the key questions that contribute to this tool are:
- are diseases real or constructed?
- do we need to relate particular disease definitions (e.g. what is CFS) to an overarching theory of disease?
- key literature: King 1954, Boorse 1975, Boorse 1977, Hesslow 1993, Cooper 2004

### Chapter 2: Making sense of diagnosis
**Case: Diagnosis** 
If the TV series *House* taught me anything at all, it is that the most interesting bit of medicine is the diagnosis. But what is this process? What kind of strategies does it employ? How are medical professionals taught to diagnose? This section attempts to reconstruct the process of diagnosis from medical teaching materials. Of note here is the relationship between diagnosis (as a process) and the clinical examination. Students are taught to perform clinical examinations, and these - all things being well - lead to the identification of an individual patient as a member of a unique diagnostic group. This is an interestingly operational definition - the operations of the clinical examination lead to the diagnosis, rather than the following of any other rules of inference.

**Tool: Classification** 
Classification has been of philosophical interest for at least two millennia. Aristotle, for example, argued that classification should be based on *essences* - causally powerful central characteristics that defined the way something must be. Very much more recently, the trend in the philosophical literature on classification has been (for want of a better word) *anti-essentialist* - that is, denying that good classifications pick out the essences of things. Instead, classifications can be made for a variety of purposes, and different ways of classifying should be preferred in different contexts. For all this philosophical pedigree, the issue of classification is is the opposite of a stale scholastic question. How classifications are made, and what that tells us about the world is of enormous practical interest and importance. Key questions here include:
- are classifications real, or human (as definitions of disease, here the question is really 'is the world really lumpy?' )
- uniqueness: is there a single best classification?
- what are classifications *for*?
- key literature: Aristotle, Dupre, Boyd

### Chapter 3: What made us sick?
**Case: Understanding disease aetiology**
This section reviews a series of transitions in the way that disease aetiology was understood. We start with Robert Koch's work on tuberculosis between 1880 and 1890. Here, the revolutionary idea was to define the disease in terms of the infectious organism that caused it. This idea - which we might call *monocausality* - fundamentally changed the way that diseases were understood in medicine. However, during the mid-twentieth century, interest in understanding chronic, non-infectious diseases - cancer particularly - grew. These diseases were hard to reconcile with Koch's monocausal ideal, largely because many different agents seemed to share some causal responsibility for bringing them about. These difficulties led to the development of new ways of understanding disease aetiology that, in one way or another, rejected the basic idea of  monocausality.

**Tool: Causation**
As in the medical case discussed above, there have been enormous shifts in the way that causes have been understood philosophically. The dominant philosophical position for most of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries seems highly anti-intuitive. Most people believe in causes: when we operate the light switch, we honestly believe that this action causes the lamp to come on. For a variety of compelling reasons most philosophers before about 1970, while admitting the power of our everyday intuitions about causes, tended to deny that these intuitions were sufficient reason to believe in causes in any more fundamental sense. However, in the later twentieth century there was an explosion of interest in examining these anti-causal arguments more critically, and a profusion of philosophical theories of causality began to emerge. This section picks out some themes from these ideas about causes, and presents them as tools for understanding some of the issues at stake in the historical case. Key questions include:
- should you believe in real causes?
- how to understand different causes? (e.g. production and difference making)
- making sense of monocausality and polycausality
- key literature: Hume, Russell 1912, Mackie 1975, MDC 2000, Psillos 2004

### Chapter 4: Does coffee cause cancer?
**Case: does coffee cause cancer?**
We frequently encounter claims in medicine that we might doubt. When (and here - research required - Daily Mail oncology ontology) we find that a UK newspaper has run 20 stories in 5 years claiming both that coffee prevents, and causes, cancer, how should we respond? Most of us (with Ben Goldacre as *primum inter pares*) tend to be very sceptical about drawing conclusions when different bits of evidence contradict one another in the short-term - largely because it seems doubtful that these studies are actually finding out anything of use about how the world works. Yet when things happen a bit more slowly, should we still apply the same sceptical principles? Medical practice and medical knowledge change (?evolve) constantly. Should this ongoing pattern of change make us similarly concerned that the kinds of theoretical things that medicine refers to (particular diseases, for instance) might not be true?

**Tool: scientific realism**
Scientific realists assert that scientific theories are true and refer to things that are real. This means that when we make some theoretical claim (about an electron, or a GLUT protein) we have every reason to think that words correspond to some real, and mind-independent, feature of the world. As with causation, though, there are very good reasons to beware of this as a general position. For example, say our current theories are real, and have replaced (I suppose we might say superseded) previous theories that were not real. Does that mean that we (with all our real theories) are justified in being realists, but that our predecessors (with their faulty theories) were not? Aren't we lucky!

This section connects this the extensive literature on scientific realism with the kinds of issues regarding theoretical change in medicine introduced in the case-study. Key questions include:
- is the belief that new theories tend to be truer than old ones justified? Even: is it sensible?
- if every previous medical theory before now was faulty, why should we trust the ones that we now have?)
- what is this thing called *truth*, anyway.

### Chapter 5: This year's model (organism)
**Case: Model organisms**
Historical: the mice are in charge / lords of the fly / worm turns;

**Tool: Models as mediators***

### Chapter 6: The plural of anecdote both is, and isn't, data

**Case: Whipple disease**
Method: the plural of anecdote both is, and isn't, data; material on group aggregation (thinking with cases / )

There might be some useful material from the WD paper to use here
**Tool: Casuistry, Simpson's paradox, and the reference-class problem**

### 7. Historical: medicalisation; tool: discovery
hypertension, or high cholesterol (making diagnostic kinds for well people
***case***
***tool***

### 8. Dilemma: EBM or the highway; tool: Minnesota pluralism (probably not Mitchell's IP, though)
***case***
***tool***

## How to use this book
How are these tools meant to work? To illustrate, I'll begin with a deliberately imperfect analogy: the use of statistics in medicine. (the Hesse point: perfect analogies are not revealing) Statistical tools are very frequently used in contemporary medicine. For example, a clinician might use basic statistical tools:
- when interpreting a report of a clinical trial
- conducting a clinical audit
- when counselling an individual patient about their risk of developing coronary heart disease

In each of these situations, a clinician might employ basic statistical tools. What should a clinician know about these? What should they expect to gain by using them?

### The glass-bead game assertion
These philosophical tools don't deliver meaning: we can't mechanically apply them to a particular bit of medical practice and (somehow) magically detect some profound truths about our situation. (I don't, for a second, want to suggest that this is what statistics in medicine should do, although the cult of statistical significance might disagree). What we can do with these philosophical tools is to use them as ways of analysing medicine from a different position. Changing our vantage point can be very useful, as we'll see. (Might those ?anamorphic car-park paintings be a neat example here?) At the outset, though, it's worth mentioning one important difference between the kind of philosophical viewpoint and those found in medicine: the way that the different groups make their arguments.(fn here - medical papers are arguments)

Instead, a tool-kit for understanding contemporary medicine.Tools connect ideas and the world, as Mary Morgan claims.

What's imperfect about the analogy: these mechanism by which these tools are constructed is disputed, in a way that is not the case for the kinds of statistical tools usually used in medicine. 
There's also, it is claimed, no progress in philosophy (emphatically disagree with this). However, philosophy is in a bad state, especially for the interested outsider (like, I hope, the readers of this book).

Chapters link up: often the philosophical questions in different tool sections overlap. For instance, the section on definitions of disease relates to diagnosis, because we are likely to treat diagnosis differently depending on whether we think that diseases are either real and natural entities or human constructions. This isn't at all unique to philosophy - in medical education, for example, many core topics tie together. It is very hard to understand pulmonary physiology without knowing at least a bit about cardiovascular physiology, and almost impossible to get to grips with mechanisms of drug action without understanding something about the underlying biochemistry and pathology. What's different here, though, is that it is possible to adopt different stances on philosophical topics without being objectively wrong. Moreover, the kinds of tool that one prefers in a given situation may have as much to do with ones general preference for the kind of perspective that those tools give in another, apparently unrelated, scenario.

Another way that the chapters of this book link up is via examples. Often, an example given in relation to one tool can easily be understood via a completely different set of tools. While this has caused some head-scratching while planning this book, I have tried to give examples that will be amenable to this kind of re-interpretation. Very brief hints as to how this can be done.

There's a good reason for trying to keep things to their chapters, though, which concerns the way I think this book is likely to be read. It's said that the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein insisted that students should commit his philosophical works to memory as a prerequisite for understanding them. I don't think the same is true here! Readers can do whatever they like, and authors can't force them to deal with the book in any particular way. (? Smug restaurants that give detailed instructions to diners as to how their meal should be approached). That proviso made, my suggestion would be to not treat this book like either a novel or a textbook. Don't try and read it all the way through, and expect some magical spirit of philosophy to emerge. I think that it is most useful as a kind of prompt, or provocation, to encourage you to think differently about something that you already know. As the book is mainly aimed at those with a medical bent, I hope that you will be able to connect what's here to elements of your own practice. I'm certainly sincerely grateful to all the medical colleagues who have suggested that something I've mentioned connected in some way with the issues they encounter in their professional lives.
