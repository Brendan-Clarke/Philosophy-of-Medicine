#Chapter 1: what on earth is the philosophy of medicine?#

##Introduction
This module is an introduction to analytic philosophy of medicine. This note is therefore an introduction to an introduction. I have two main goals in writing. First, I want to situate the intellectual content and methods of the module within philosophy as a subject. Second, I will make some comments on the reading set for this week (Caplan 1992).

The first goal – situating the module – may strike you as a rather curious starting point. Particularly for those of you who haven’t done much philosophy before, the notion of outlining the shape and relations of a subject will probably feel rather alien. For most subjects – particularly in the sciences –explicitly considering which parts of a topic are important, and which are not, does not form part of the subject itself. But in this respect, philosophy is not like the sciences. What kind of a philosopher an author is matters, and it matters because there are traditions and factions in philosophy that there are not in many parts of the sciences. (That is not to say that philosophy is unique in having these different positions: to pull a few examples off the top of my head, we can find similar disputes about concepts and methods in biology, physics, and psychiatry too).These traditions and factions each have their own methods and techniques, and it is this that can makes philosophical ideas and techniques taken out of context somewhat hard to understand. Given that about half the students sitting this module usually have had little previous exposure to philosophy, I want to set out some key elements of this intellectual background below. While schematic, what follows should be just about sufficient to let you discover where a particular author is coming from – something that can be very hard to grasp when you a) haven’t read much philosophy before and b) are struggling with the details of a particular argument. It should also be just about enough to illuminate the way that this course is put together. At the very least, this background knowledge should leave you able to judge why particular ideas and schools of thought are included from our discussions, and why some area excluded.  When it comes to these kind of choices – about what to read, or how to critique ideas - I hope that I will make my thinking as transparent as possible. If I fail – as I’m sure I will – then do ask for clarification.

The next section of this introduction should hopefully give those of you who are new to the subject a very brief outline of the intellectual territory surrounding and shaping the things that we will discuss during the course of the term. For those of you with rather more previous experience of philosophy of science, perhaps this short introduction will provoke your interest in the role of meta-philosophical questions – philosophical questions about philosophy, in other words. We (and here, I mean teachers of philosophy) don’t spend very much time thinking about how philosophy itself is made up. In the interests of working with students to develop their skills at the practice of philosophy (reading research articles and writing essays), we tend to neglect the much bigger questions about why and how philosophy should be done. So, for those of you with more experience in doing philosophy of science, I encourage you to read through the following with a comparative gaze: how does this square with what you have learned about philosophy of science in other places?

 I’ve added a short glossary of terms at the end of this introduction, which might be helpful in coming to terms with the relevant philosophical jargon. We will spend part of our tutorial time coming up with some useful definitions for these terms. Again, if there are terms that are not clear to you, perhaps you can let me know so that I might add them. More broadly, if any sections of this note don’t make sense to you, let me know, and I will clarify them. I want these notes to evolve over time, and your contributions to this are vital.

A few words on how I intend these notes to be used. Producing written notes on each topic is a new method for me. In previous incarnations of this course, I tried to deliver most of this (more factual) content via traditional lectures. However, I found that it took too much time away from class discussions. As discussions and arguments seem to be vital for developing  your own philosophical skills, I’ve moved to this new way of doing things. My intention is that you can read these introductions in advance of the sessions, together with the relevant journal article (or other piece of research work) set for the week. You can also use these notes as a basis for exam preparation: the exam questions will follow from what is set out here. Finally, make sure you review the module aims and objectives.

The aims of the module are:

1. to note that there is a degree continuity of philosophy of medicine with general philosophy of science.
2.	to argue that careful consideration of historical and pragmatic factors are generally a significant part of doing good philosophy of medicine.
3.	to prepare students for further study of this subject.

By the end of this course students will:

1. understand the major issues in the five philosophical topics covered in the course
2.	appreciate the role of historical and pragmatic factors in shaping philosophical discourse
3.	develop appropriate critical, reading, writing, and presentation skills



This lecture note is set out as follows. First, I’ll give a short outline of Caplan’s 1992 paper, which is the required reading for this week. I’ll then outline some questions about this argument which we will discuss during our tutorial this week. Next, I’ll give some useful background to Caplan’s paper, which will take the form of a short history of contemporary philosophy of science. On with Caplan… 


##Caplan (1992), and the question of whether philosophy of medicine exists##

###Summary###

This paper begins with a question: does philosophy of medicine exist? [^pom-exist] The author immediately explains the rationale for asking this question. Researchers have been arguing that philosophy of medicine must expand its intellectual horizons:

> There has been a great deal of discussion in recent years…about how to broaden the field of the philosophy of medicine beyond the consideration of ethical issues. [Caplan 1992: 67][Caplan 1992]

However, this call to action is meaningless if the field of philosophy of medicine does not exist ([Caplan 1992: 67][Caplan 1992]). Caplan then goes on to argue that philosophy of medicine does fail to exist as a field of enquiry. His argument for this conclusion takes two parts. First, a process of defining what philosophy of medicine is, and how it might be distinguished from other kinds of philosophical activity. Second, by showing that nothing exists that satisfies this definition.

Definitions first. Caplan begins by suggesting that there is no widely used definition of philosophy of medicine ([Caplan 1992: 68][Caplan 1992]). He therefore attempts his own, in part via a process of distinguishing philosophy of medicine from other philosophical work in and around medicine: 

1. Philosophy **of** medicine is not the same thing as bioethics, because bioethics is normative, while philosophy of medicine concentrates on epistemic and metaphysical issues
2.	Neither is philosophy of medicine the same as the kinds of philosophical work (aesthetics, mainly) that fall under the rubric of **humanities in medicine**. This, like biomedical ethics, is more correctly described as philosophy **and** medicine or philosophy **in** medicine ([Caplan 1992: 69][Caplan 1992])
3.	Philosophy **of** medicine: what he’s concerned with. His definition is as follows: 

> The philosophy of medicine is the study of the epistemological, metaphysical and methodological dimensions of medicine; therapeutic and experimental; diagnostic, therapeutic, and palliative. The key problems facing the philosophy of medicine are or ought to be those which are tackled by those in cognate areas of the philosophy of science – the nature of theories and laws, the logic of explanations and predictions, the analysis of models, paradigms and metaphors, the analysis of theoretical change over time, the explication of key concepts, the analysis of the methods, assumptions, and goals of medical activities and, the examination of the ontological foundations of medical research, nosology and practice. In short, the philosophy of medicine is a sub-discipline of the philosophy of science. [Caplan 1992: 69](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00489220#page-1 "Caplan, A.L., 1992. Does the philosophy of medicine exist? Theoretical Medicine 13, 67–77.")

Caplan then argues that philosophy of medicine (as a sub-discipline of philosophy of science) does not exist. He evidence in support of this claim is as follows: if philosophy of medicine is a branch of philosophy of science, then it would “be subject to all the intellectual currents and storms which buffet that general field.” [Caplan 1992: 70](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00489220#page-1 "Caplan, A.L., 1992. Does the philosophy of medicine exist? Theoretical Medicine 13, 67–77."). In particular, things that are written in philosophy of medicine would be subject to interrogation and argument by medical practitioners themselves. As this does not happen, philosophy of medicine does not exist:

> If the philosophy of medicine existed, it would and should be the topic of much debate, anguish, posturing and mutual recrimination between those doing the philosophizing and those actual[ly] engaged in the daily practice of medicine. But it is not. (Caplan 1992: 70)

This concludes Caplan’s main argument concerning the non-existence of philosophy of medicine. He next turns to three possible responses to it (Caplan 1992: 70-1). These are:

1.	To accept that Caplan’s definitions and evidence are okay, and to conclude that philosophy of medicine does not exist
2.	To accept that philosophy of medicine – as defined by Caplan as a branch of philosophy of science – does not exist, but to argue that this definition is inappropriate, and to argue instead that philosophy of medicine might well include other issues like bioethics. Caplan responds by calling this response “possible but not plausible” (Caplan 1992: 71), on the grounds that the aims of philosophy of medicine (as defined by Caplan) are very different from those of bioethics. While philosophy of medicine is descriptive, looking to describe and analyse medical practice, bioethics is normative, and aims to suggest how medical practice should be. These different aims (presumably) make doing both kinds of practice together as part of one unified discipline implausible for Caplan.
3.	<!--- This point is not as clear as it should be --->
To accept Caplan’s definitions, but to argue that the evidence he relies on when making the claim that philosophy of medicine does not exist is not, particularly the existence of lots of published works, conferences and societies that are identified as philosophy of medicine-ish activities. Caplan concedes that these do, in fact, exist, but that they do not constitute a field:


> …I must concede that the works and activities I have cited do satisfy my definition of what constitutes the philosophy of medicine. But, having made that concession, I want to argue that many articles, a considerable number of books and even a number of very good journals do not a field make. (Caplan 1992: 72)

This final point requires further development, which Caplan attempts in section 3 (Caplan 1992: 72). For a subject to be a field, he argues that it must satisfy three requirements:

1.	It must be integrated into cognate areas of inquiry.
2.	It must have a canon of “core readings, articles, books and case studies which are taught to those wishing to enter the field and cited by those who see themselves as working collegially in the field.”
3.	It must have problems that define its boundaries

But philosophy of medicine does not meet these criteria. It is not, argues Caplan, integrated into cognate areas of inquiry, instead being an “isolated island” (Caplan 1992: 72). Next, there is no canon of required reading, and we can detect this absence most reliably by noting the absence of argument about what counts as canonical in the field (Caplan 1992: 73). Finally, philosophy of medicine lacks defining problems. Caplan concedes that there are a few problems – particularly that of defining health and disease – that might be though to define the field in this way, but that they are jointly insufficient to transform philosophy of medicine into a proper field of inquiry. It is, instead, a “mixed set of ruminations” (Caplan 1992: 73). 

Caplan finds this shortcoming regrettable, as he develops in section four. Other fields need philosophy of medicine, and they need it to develop as a field in its own right. Specifically, philosophy of science badly needs philosophy of medicine to provide examples of science in practice.

Bioethics, on the other hand, needs philosophy of medicine to resolve puzzles concerning the nature and purpose of medicine itself (Caplan 1992: 74). Finally, medicine itself needs the philosophy of medicine in order to contribute to the resolution of problems of medical importance, like the design of clinical trials, or computer-aided diagnosis. “the philosophy of medicine has the potential to make vital contributions” (Caplan 1992: 74) in this way.
<!--- Add closing paragraph: despite failures in evidence and method, Caplan picks the eventual result (PoM, ethics, medical humanities) really well. Should this be regarded as a tactical document, rather than a useful bit of philosophy? Also, difficult to measure boundaries of fields – ethics and PoM clearly interact. Problem with Caplan’s simple view of the question of integration of fields, cf. --->

###Questions about Caplan 1992

Question: I asserted that there were philosophy-like traditions and factions to be found in the sciences. Can you think of any specific examples? What might these tell us about the various ideas concerning the unity of science expounded by the logical positivists? (see below if that sentence doesn’t make any sense to you just yet).

Question: What kind of definition is his definition of philosophy of medicine? Do you think it is a good one? Why?

Question: Does all good philosophy of science have to interact in some way with science?
 
Question: I don’t trust Caplan’s definitions of a field at all, mainly because there seem to be lots of examples of similarly isolated, yet thriving, fields. Can you think of any ways of defending it?

Question: What, really, is wrong with mixing bioethics and philosophy of medicine? [Ankeny (2003)][Ankeny 2003] might be a good place to begin.

Question: Is there really not a canon for teaching philosophy of medicine? Isn’t Spike (1991) a sufficient counterexample to Caplan’s claim here? Is there a canon for teaching medicine?


##Philosophy of medicine


As this module is about analytic philosophy of medicine, the general objective is to engage with the scientific features of medicine in a philosophical way (*pace* Caplan). That is not to say that this course exhausts the space of all possible philosophical engagements with medicine - there are many well-established and intellectually mature kinds of philosophical work that we won’t really consider during the next ten weeks. Just for example, we won’t really think about medical ethics, or moral philosophy applied to medicine, concentrating instead on philosophical questions about the scientific aspects of medicine. Another example of things we will chose to neglect is work that comes from the (rather patronisingly named) tradition of Continental philosophy – something that I will briefly comment on below. My reasons for this selection of topics – aside from the pragmatic issue of keeping the course syllabus down to a manageable size – arise from the very broad meta-philosophical questions that I mentioned at the start of this note. This is a question of philosophical tradition: I intend this course to follow in the tradition of philosophy of science as applied to medicine. To explain what this rather awkward phrase means, especially  to those of you who are newcomers to this kind of work, I’d like to set out an absurdly compressed history of the philosophy of science. **there are lots of good guides available, like carrier's 2012 chapter**

In the first decade of the twentieth century, it still made sense to speak of philosophy as a single subject. That is not to say that there was anything like agreement in all things between all philosophers, nor is it to say that all philosophers worked on the same problems or used the same techniques. What it does say, though, is that the factionalism and profound heterogeneity in questions and approaches of later twentieth century philosophy was not present to the same extent. As the very brief introduction above suggests, it is now possible for good, scholarly, philosophical work to fail to engage with other philosophical work that covers similar (if not identical) ground. But a hundred or so years ago, philosophers did not make such sweeping demarcations between traditions of philosophy. And if we look back into the history of philosophy, we can see that early figures in these now distinct traditions were actually in rather closer intellectual contact than would now be usual. So we know, for example, that leading figures in each of the three main philosophy of science movements of the mid-twentieth century - [Russell](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/russell/), [James](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/james/) and [Husserl](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/husserl/) - were familiar with each other’s works (O’Grady 2002: 6). So this story is one of increasing intellectual alienation, leading to the formation of different factions in philosophy. Some understanding of these factions is necessary to come to grips with the philosophical work that we will be doing this term.

In particular, I’d like to provide some background to the following aspects of the philosophical ground we’ll be covering.

1. Analytic tradition. What is this analytic tradition, where does it come from, and how might if shape the way that we do this philosophy?
2. Philosophy of science.
3. Philosophy of medicine

This little history of the twentieth century Cold War in philosophy is, of course, schematic. There are some really useful general readings that might shed further light on these changes. Of particular note are Gillies’ (1993) history of the philosophy of science, Russell’s  (2004 (1945)) history of philosophy in general, or the more focused accounts to be found in Brown (2012). I’ve also linked or cited suitable resources in the text.

Let’s begin with one of the three figures mentioned above: Bertrand Russell

###Russell and Wittgenstein

[Russell](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/russell/) began his career as a fairly orthodox Kantian (i.e. follower of the work of [Immanual Kant](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant/)), but rapidly moved to work from a much less metaphysical, and more strongly analytic stance under the tutelage of [G.E. Moore](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moore/) at Cambridge. As most converts, he was to become highly critical of his former beliefs: 

> Idealism has produced habits of confusion even in the minds of those who think that they have rejected it. (Russell 1922)

He is particularly associated with two very grand philosophical projects based on logic. The first of these was the infamous *Principia Mathematica*.[^principia-mathematica]  Produced between 1903 and 1913 in collaboration with [A.N. Whitehead](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/whitehead/), this is a formidably difficult and ambitious piece of analytic philosophy, that aimed to place mathematics on the sure and certain foundations of deductive logic.

![A sample page from the Principia Mathematica. Note the last line...](http://i.imgur.com/RdAVqZw.png)

This exert comes from p.379 of the first edition. Note the remark at the bottom. My intention in showing you this extract is to make a point about their method of logical analysis. The details of Russell and Whitehead’s work is not important for us, but the analytic method of thinking about commonplace things – like 1+1 equalling 2 – in a really formal and rigorous way certainly is important. John Campbell once described philosophy as [a way of finding alternatives to our usual beliefs by thinking in slow motion](http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2008/02/what-is-philoso.html "Philosophy is thinking in slow motion"), and this is a useful (if extreme) example of this. While impressive, the project was not successful. Those interested in why this was the case might like to glance through Nagel’s short (and highly readable) book on Gödel (Nagel and Newman 2012 (1958)).
 
The other pillar of Russell’s work was the philosophy of logical atomism: (See Russell 1918-9, or the useful analysis [at the SEP](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logical-atomism/)), most important for our purposes for the description of the method of analysis. To quote the SEP article:

> The methodological view recommends a process of analysis, whereby one attempts to define or reconstruct more complex notions or vocabularies in terms of simpler ones. According to Russell…such an analysis could eventually result in a language containing only words representing simple particulars, the simple properties and relations thereof, and logical constants, which, despite this limited vocabulary, could adequately capture all truths.
[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logical-atomism/](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logical-atomism/)

This method of logical analysis is why we call this kind of philosophy analytic philosophy. Contemporary philosophers pay an intellectual debt to Russell in virtue of this general method, although the precise details of it have long fallen from favour.[^contemporary-analytic]  Just as Aristotle, Russell provides the general outline of the much of the methodology of contemporary philosophy of science. One who would shape contemporary philosophy is a much more complicated way was a pupil of Russell: Wittgenstein.

Wittgenstein’s critiques of Russell (see the sometimes formidable entry [at the SEP](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein/), or  chapter 8 of Gillies (1993) as a more gentle introduction). Wittgenstein’s work is usually divided into two periods. The early Wittgenstein (particularly the *Tractatus logico-philosophicus* (Wittgenstein 2001 (1921)) was mainly concerned with using logical methods to investigate philosophy itself. Wittgenstein began working in philosophy in Cambridge as a student of Russell’s in 1912, but rapidly came to intellectually dominate his former mentor, playing a key role in shaping Russell’s philosophical views. The touching introduction to Russell’s 1918-9 reveals both the personal and intellectual connections that existed between the two:

> The following articles are the first two lectures of a course of eight lectures delivered in London in the first months of 1918 and are very largely concerned with explaining certain ideas which I learnt from my friend and former pupil Ludwig Wittgenstein. I have had no opportunity of knowing his views since August, 1914, and I do not even know whether he is alive or dead. He has therefore no responsibility for what is said in these lectures beyond that of having originally supplied many of the theories contained in them. (Russell 1918-9: part 1-2, pp. 495)

As the introduction suggests, the outbreak of the first world war saw Wittgenstein leave Cambridge for service in the Austrian army. It was here, serving on the Eastern front, that he completed the only book published during his lifetime: the *tractatus*. This book is set out in an unusual way. Rather than the usual paragraphs of text, or strings of logical symbols, it took the form of a long series of hierarchically-arranged, numbered, propositions:

![A sample from Wittgenstein's Tractatus. 'Ogden' and 'Pears/McGuinness' refer to two different English translations of Wittgenstein’s original German](http://i.imgur.com/V6iuzuZ.png)

There is a great deal in the *Tractatus* (see the useful summary [at the SEP](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein/#TLP)). For me, the most striking thing about the book is its odd combination of logicism and mysticism. On the one hand, the work is intensely logical, both in method and in subject (the analysis of propositions particularly). On the other hand, Wittgenstein makes a great many semi-mystical comments, which perhaps arose from the rather grisly circumstances in which Wittgenstein was writing, have been partly responsible for the followers of Wittgenstein becoming the closest modern philosophy has to a cult of personality. I suppose the most important legacy of the logical side of the work is the attempt to demarcate science from non-science. Of this, Wittgenstein argues that the domain of science consists of things that can be expressed linguistically. But some things exist that may not be expressed in this way. Instead, they can just be shown (gezeigt). These latter unexpressible but showable things are for metaphysics.  This distinction between science and metaphysics was of great importance to the Vienna Circle, as we’ll discuss below.

By contrast, the later Wittgenstein (2001 (1953): *the Philosophical Investigations*) would argue vehemently against these logical methods. In the *Philosophical Investigations*, Wittgenstein argued instead for a new method which would be the cornerstone of a new kind of philosophy. This new philosophy would rejected dogmatism in all things, and therefore rejected the logical analysis of ideal languages (whether the highly structured and precise German of the *tractatus*, or the dense symbolic logic of the *Principia mathematica*) in factor of the analysis of ordinary language.

> For a large class of cases—though not for all—in which we employ the word ‘meaning’ it can be defined thus: the meaning of a word is its use in the language (Wittgenstein 2001 (1953) §43).

This meaning was to be found by considering the role that words play in ‘language games’ – a novel concept coined by Wittgenstein. The rough idea here is that we can detect the rules of language in a process analogous to understanding the rules of games – by studying the way that each are played (for a brief introduction, see the [fairly decent Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language-game_(philosophy)) - although be advised that the concept remained undefined by Wittgenstein in any strict sense. Necessary and sufficient definitions were not how the later Wittgenstein worked). There are other things that set this approach well apart from most other philosophical work of this period too, particularly Wittgenstein’s concern with the therapeutic powers of philosophy. This puts me in mind of the Marxist ambitions toward intervention – “The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point is to change it.” (Marx and Engels 1969 (1845): 15).

Anyway, this is getting rather digressive. There’s certainly no need for you to read either Wittgenstein or Russell as part of this course. What you should take from this is an awareness of their influence on other philosophers. Both supplied formative contributions to what would become philosophy of science, and a rudimentary awareness of roughly what this was (particularly the method(s) of logical analysis) is really helpful to understand the way that the subject came to be. Crudely, the work of Russell together with the early Wittgenstein feed into logical positivism (particularly in Central Europe), while the later Wittgenstein forms the basis for the ordinary-language philosophy movement, which was primarily associated with the UK (see below), as well as continental philosophy of various different stripes.

###Logical positivism
Positivism, in this context, this doesn’t mean anything like optimism or perkiness, but instead comes from the work of [Auguste Comte](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/comte/), the French philosopher of the first half of the C19. Here, positivity means something rather close to the modern sense of testable. Positivism is therefore a doctrine that is concerned with how particular claims might be possibly proven. If this sounds too uncontroversial to bother saying, this is in part a consequence of the circulation that this idea has had over the past 200 years or so. One particularly resonant place that this idea was heard was in the various philosophical circles and groups found in Vienna and in Berlin in the years following WWI. Here, this idea that testing might be the most important doctrine in all of philosophy took root in the rich soil of Russell’s logical atomism, and Wittgenstein’s critique of these ideas. These groups, known by various titles – the [Vienna circle](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/vienna-circle/) as the best known among several similar organisations - became known as the logical positivists. As [Rudolf Carnap](http://www.iep.utm.edu/carnap/) – a key member of movement via the Vienna circle - defined it, positivism in this context is a doctrine in which 

> every term of the whole language L of science is reducible to what we may call sense-data terms or perception terms ([Carnap 1936: 463-4][Carnap-1936]). 

This was a strongly empiricist turn in philosophy, in turn owing debts back to [David Hume](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume/)’s scepticism about induction and other matters. In this way, logical positivism was just one of many variations on the theme of philosophies grounded in experience. What set this broad intellectual tribe apart from many other philosophers working in the European tradition was a strongly anti-metaphysical bent – almost a revulsion for the conventional metaphysical approach of philosophy. This strongly metaphysical work became the dominant philosophical tradition during the second half of the nineteenth century, largely due to the influence of Kant, Hegel, and followers.

These metaphysical schemes promised insight into the world in ways not open to more empirical (read, for our purposes, scientific) types of inquiry.

> One answer that was available at the time that logical empiricism flourished was that the genuinely philosophic remainder after the departure of the sciences is somehow deeper than the empirical sciences and gets at matters, perhaps cultural ones, that are more profound and important than anything that empirical science even can address. This is either because on this conception philosophy has a mode of access or “evidence” that the empirical sciences do not and cannot have or because the very idea of fidelity to evidence and punctilious argument is somehow small-minded. ([http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logical-empiricism/](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logical-empiricism/))


Very, very, crudely, logical positivist authors felt that this was a mistake. Far from being a uniquely privileged way of understanding the world, these heavily metaphysical doctrines instead dealt largely with philosophical problems that were not meaningful problems at all. As Carnap conceived it, these philosophers were working on *pseudoproblems*: artefacts produced by poor formulation or lack of linguistic clarity, rather than real philosophical problems. In place of these grand schemes of metaphysics, the logical positivists promoted a stripped down conception of philosophy, but one with extremely broad ambitions – well beyond those found in contemporary philosophy of science:

> this engagement was accompanied by the conviction that their cultures were incapable of the necessary reform and renewal because people were in effect enslaved by unscientific, metaphysical ways of thinking. Such ways of thinking might be exemplified in theology, in the racial hatreds of the day, in conceptions of property, and in traditional ideas about the “proper” roles of men and women in society. So to articulate a “scientific world conception” and to defend it against metaphysics was not just to express an academic position in the narrow sense. It was a political act as well; it was to strike a blow for the liberation of the mind. To articulate scientific methods and a scientific conception of philosophy was the essential first step in the reform of society and in the emancipation of humankind.
([http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logical-empiricism/](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logical-empiricism/))

This meant basing a philosophy in experience. But experience was just a base for conceptual work. And this conceptual work was to specify (in a rather daunting way) the correct way that these reasons should participate in inferences. Thus LP becomes a project largely concerned with specifying the structure of reasoning in the sciences. In turn, this meant a reframing of this work. From looking to philosophy as a mother discipline (as Russell, for instance, did), the Vienna circle became much more closely allied to science. This move to scientism, which took place gradually between 1924 and 1929, remains influential in philosophy of science without ever being fully accepted by all philosophers. As things currently stand, there is a great deal of variability in this kind of influence visible in philosophy of science. Some work (particularly, as we’ll discuss later, the more practically and historically engaged movements in philosophy that arose during the 1980s and 1990s) is highly science-y in methods, focus, and presentation. But in other contexts, the philosophy dominates the science. For me, it is this tension between the philosophical and the scientific that makes philosophy of science much more rewarding than either of its influencing disciplines. But you may well not agree with me here!

We might say a great deal else about the intellectual influence of the Vienna circle in general, but I’ll leave that as an exercise to the interest. You can find a brief introductory essay in chapter one of Gillies (1993), as well as lots of material in and via the [relevant SEP entry](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/vienna-circle/), and some useful work about individuals involved in the circle (Cat, Cartwright, and Chang 1996). Rather than the details of what this influence has been, I want to instead describe the way in which this influence came about.

The Vienna circle dispersed in the late-1930s. The war, the assassination of one of the circle (Schlick) by a Nazi-affiliated student, the Jewish background of some of the members, the socialist outlook of others, and the scientism of the group as a whole (against the rather metaphysical Nazi concepts of blood and race) all contributed to a diaspora of former members of the circle to (relatively) friendly academic situations in Britain and the United States. The effects of this for Anglophone philosophy of science were to be dramatic, and important in explaining the shape of philosophy of science in the second half of the twentieth century.

> English-language philosophy of science is still dominated by ideas brought to it by refugees. In the first wave, England got the Austrians, including Karl Popper and Otto Neurath (not to mention Wittgenstein), and later got Paul Feyerabend from Vienna and Imre Lakatos from Budapest. The United States got the Germans, including Rudolf Carnap and Hans Reichenbach.…the Germans who went to the United States were a solemn lot, at least in print, who have cast a sombre shadow of propriety over American philosophy of science to this day. The Austro-Hungarians, in contrast, were a wild bunch, never comfortable anywhere, but finding England the best refuge. (Hacking 2000)	

###Post-war philosophy of science
The upshot of this scattering of refugees was the establishment of three rather different traditions in philosophy of science. The first of these was Anglophone, and was largely based around German emigrees to the United States. Here, they continued to work in the logical positivist tradition from before the war, although now rubbing up against the very different philosophical backdrop of the US, which was dominated by pragmatism (James, Dewey). This school of emigrees and sympathetic American philosophers – Reichenbach, Gödel, Carnap, Neurath, Hempel and Quine - produced much highly formal and rigorous philosophical work. A very nice example of this is Richenbach’s 1938 book *Experience and Prediction*. Here, the focus is largely on science in the abstract (essentially, a kind of idealised theoretical physics was the model of scientific practice for most of these philosophers), while the approach is firmly analytic, involving the reduction of problems into formal logic, followed by the analysis of these logical constructions.[^cold-war] 

The second of these philosophical schools was also Anglophone, but incomparably different in method and scope. This dominant philosophical tradition in the UK involved the analysis of language as used in its ordinary context, which gave rise to the commonly-used label of *ordinary language philosophy*, as opposed to *ideal language philosophy* (i.e. based in formal logic) in the United States

Ordinary language philosophy arose from Wittgenstein’s later work (Wittgenstein 2001), and centred in the Oxford school of J.L Austin, Gilbert Ryle, Peter Strawson et al. There’s a very nice essay on the downfall of ordinary-language philosophy that might suit those of you who enjoy their history of philosophy (Uschanov 2001). There is, of course, no need to read this unless you are interested, but it is worth extracting one quotation to illustrate one curious feature of ordinary language philosophy. This is its amazingly rapid fall from grace. From being the usual technique for philosophical discourse in the UK in about 1950, by 1960 it was utterly dead. Uschanov writes:

> Many philosophical schools that oppose each other implacably — Popperians, positivists, Marxists, poststructuralists, and so on — agree on one thing: OLP was wrong and its disappearance was a good thing indeed. OLP has become the ultimate "good enemy" in the history of twentieth-century philosophy. Over the years, philosophers have charged it with worshipping "the mid-morning incuriosity and philistinism of the mean sensual man" (Heath 1962: 177); emitting "masochistic twilight of resignation" (Cory 1969: 1115); having been "the Bertie Wooster season in philosophy" (Grene 1995: 55); representing "dinosaur-ism of the deepest dye" (Magee 1997: 53). Critics have spoken of OLP as "a deviation from the true path of philosophy" (Tomlin 1977: 232) and "an aberration" (Mundle 1970: 7) that recommends "giving up the calling of philosophy" (Meyerhoff and Main 1960: 183). Even an admirer recently characterized it as "quaintly passé" and "a soi-disant ‘movement’ that even in its heyday attracted a venom" (Lyas 1996b: 347–348). For a while, the anti-OLP tirade almost seemed to become a separate literary form with its own genre rules (e. g. Cory 1969; Rosen 1969: 1–27; Tomlin 1977; Anderson 1992: 65–70).
(Uschanov 2001 – you can find the references on the original article)

A third school, and one that I will ignore almost completely, was that of Continental philosophy. This ‘continental’ refers to a wide variety of philosophical approaches that exist outside of the analytic tradition that we’ve discussed above. I don’t want to attempt a characterisation of continental philosophy here, but using a very broad brush I might point to the role of metaphysical and extra-scientific forms of knowledge as important to this kind of work, very often built into grand interpretative schemes (you might have heard of existentialism or structuralism, as examples). While much of this work was originally geographically continental, particularly in Germany (Heidegger, e.g.) and France (existentialism), a similar process of diaspora to that of the Vienna circle occurred in these other intellectual circles too. Now, the ‘continental’ in continental philosophy is firmly non-geographical, and this kind of work is extensively practiced in the Anglophone world.[^continental-phil]  It’s important to us in two respects. First, lots of philosophy of medicine is in this continental tradition (Foucault, Canguilhem, to pick out two philosophers of note). While we won’t be talking about this work very much in our lectures and tutorials, when it comes to essay-time you might well end up wanting to write about this kind of philosophical work. This is fine by me, but you need to be aware of the implications of the different philosophical traditions if you do venture outside the analytic tradition. Second, some of these continental philosophers influenced late 20th century analytic philosophy of science directly – particularly that associated with the Stanford school (see later lecture notes for details).


###The Historical Turn
Sometime during  the late 1950s, a more historically-informed philosophy of science began to emerge in the US. The major point of contrast was with the highly technical approach to logical empiricism that is particularly associated with Carnap and Reichenbach. Here, instead of thinking about the ideals of the scientific method, this approach was characterised by a renewed interest in the details of scientific practices as the major driver of philosophical work, particularly via the study of the history of science. By about 1970, this new school was pre-eminent, eclipsing logical empiricism: 

> by the 1970s logical empiricism was reduced further. No longer a participant in science, it was remembered as a school of commentary about science. (Reisch, 2005: 5)

This turn towards historical methods begins in earnest with the publication in 1962 of Kuhn’s The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. Here, Kuhn began by pointing out the transformative power of thinking about history for the sake of philosophy. History can “produce a decisive transformation in the image of science” (Kuhn 1962: 1). Writing at about the same time, Norwood Russell Hanson  put things even more strongly.

> …history of science without philosophy of science is blind…[but]…philosophy of science without history of science is empty. (Hanson 1962: 580)

This historical turn in philosophy of science will form the backdrop to our next topic: discovery.

[^pom-exist]: Useful commentary on this debate regarding the existence of philosophy of medicine can be found in Marcum (2008), while specific commentaries on Caplan are to be found in Velanovich (1994) and Stempsey (2008). You might also be interested in Stempsey (2005), which is an interesting counterpart to Caplan’s paper.

[^principia-mathematica]: You can find a copy of the whole thing [online](http://name.umdl.umich.edu/AAT3201.0001.001), and a fairly readable summary via the [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/principia-mathematica/). But the best general introduction that I know of is Doxiadis and Papadimitriou (2009), which is a graphic novel about the life and work of Bertrand Russell.

[^contemporary-analytic]: That said, there is substantial disagreement regarding how to characterise the activities of contemporary analytic philosophy. Papineau (2009) is a good place to start if you’re interested in this topic.

[^cold-war]: Reisch (2005) convincingly argues that narrowing of logical positivism in America was largely due to the political climate of the times, with the McCarthy-ite anti-red agitation bearing much of the responsibility for the changes found in this largely immigrant community. Whatever the cause, the initially broad, sweeping, socially ambitious programme associated with the scientific worldview of the Vienna Circle manifesto (Neurath, Schlich et al) essentially becoming extinct by 1959, to be replaced by the narrow and technical philosophical work of Carnap and Reichenbach. It’s less clear to me how other factors in the post-war US contributed to this technical term, particularly the background interest in pragmatism found there. Some philosophers - Morris Raphael Cohen especially – made serious attempts to unify American pragmatism with the incoming logical positivism.
