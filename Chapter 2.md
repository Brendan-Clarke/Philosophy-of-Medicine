#Chapter 2: discovery and diagnosis
<!---I had to do the usual induction/deduction explanation during the lecture for this. Worth including here?

Also, poss think about giving a) list of reasons that discovery is important (Nobel), b) list of ‘classic’ problems in discovery (real v constructed, logic of discovery…) here?

##Introduction
This chapter, and accompanying pair of lecture-tutorials, is about discovery in medicine. In the notes accompanying the previous topic, I mentioned that we’d be discussing the turn towards thinking seriously about history of science in philosophy of science. And so, the prophesy has come to pass – this week, we’ll be examining Kuhn’s model of discovery as applied to medicine.

This lecture note chapter aims to:

1. Introduce the concept of discovery, and note that many philosophers and historians have written on it
2.	To introduce one of these - Kuhn’s model of discovery – in more depth
3.	To give short notes on some examples of discovery in medicine
4.	To use these examples to critique Kuhn’s model of discovery

##On discovery
Let me paint you a picture of the traditional view of discovery: Archimedes and his principle of displacement. The paragraph on Wikipedia is a good example of how discovery is often presented as something like the instantaneous (and striking) understanding of a previously unexplained (or unnoticed) natural phenomenon. 

>The most widely known anecdote about Archimedes tells of how he invented a method for determining the volume of an object with an irregular shape. According to Vitruvius, a votive crown for a temple had been made for King Hiero II, who had supplied the pure gold to be used, and Archimedes was asked to determine whether some silver had been substituted by the dishonest goldsmith. Archimedes had to solve the problem without damaging the crown, so he could not melt it down into a regularly shaped body in order to calculate its density. While taking a bath, he noticed that the level of the water in the tub rose as he got in, and realized that this effect could be used to determine the volume of the crown. For practical purposes water is incompressible, so the submerged crown would displace an amount of water equal to its own volume. By dividing the mass of the crown by the volume of water displaced, the density of the crown could be obtained. This density would be lower than that of gold if cheaper and less dense metals had been added. Archimedes then took to the streets naked, so excited by his discovery that he had forgotten to dress, crying "Eureka!" (Greek: "e????a!," meaning "I have found it!"). The test was conducted successfully, proving that silver had indeed been mixed in.

([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#Archimedes.27_principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#Archimedes.27_principle))

With this case in mind, let’s have a look at Kuhn’s account of discovery.

##Kuhn’s model of discovery
Even a glance at the first page of Kuhn’s paper shows that he disagrees with the model of point discovery found in the Archimedes case: “To the historian discovery is seldom a unit event attributable to some particular man, time, and place.” (Kuhn 1962: 760). I’ll set out the main elements of this argument against point discovery below, and we will also spend some time in class reconstructing it. However, for our purposes, the main thrust of this article is not this refutation, but its replacement – Kuhn’s model of discovery.

Kuhn begins with a puzzle. Knowing who discovered something is important, and much historical elbow-grease has been expended trying to find out about discoveries. Despite this attention, though, often it has not proven possible to pinpoint “the time and place at which a given discovery could properly be said to have ‘been made.’” (Kuhn 1962: 761). Why is this?

Kuhn’s response to this puzzle is as follows: this apparent failure of finding out arises because of a category mistake about discovery. Far from being point events, occurring in a particular place at a particular time, **most** discoveries occur gradually, and involve more than one researcher: “…there is no single moment or day which the historian, however complete his data, can identify as the point at which the discovery was made. Often, when several individuals are involved, it is even impossible unequivocally to identify any one of them as the discoverer.” (Kuhn 1962: 763).

Now this vagueness regarding time, person, and place, initially seems hard to reconcile with our knowledge of the Archimedes case. The key to understanding Kuhn’s point here is the phrase ‘**most discoveries**’, because it indicates a classification of kinds of discovery. These are **troublesome **discoveries, and **expected** discoveries. Kuhn elucidates:

>The troublesome class consists of those discoveries…which could not have been predicted from accepted theory in advance and which therefore caught the assembled profession by surprise.
(Kuhn 1962: 761)

Expected discoveries, on the other hand, are those that are predicted by theory. Kuhn’s examples here are rather schematic, but a good example might be the [discovery of a new element that fills a blank spot on the periodic table](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanium#History), or the [discovery of a planet via some mathematical prediction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_of_Neptune). I think we could also include Archimedes’ discovery here too, but perhaps we can reserve that argument for tutorial time. The point is that the discoverer in these cases both a) “knew from the start what to look for” (Kuhn 1962: 761) and b) had “criteria which told them when their goal had been reached.” (Kuhn 1962: 761). As a result, this kind of discovery does not suffer from the problems of vagueness that characterise troublesome discoveries. As a consequence of some interest to the historian, making identifications of the date of an expected discovery, or of the identity of its discoverer, are only limited by the available evidence. 

Things are rather different for the troublesome discovery. Kuhn illustrates by giving three examples – the discovery of oxygen, the discovery of Uranus, and the discovery of X-rays. In these cases, neither of Kuhn’s two characteristics of expected discovery (a) and b) above) were the case. Instead, even when there is plenty of historical evidence available, the kinds of questions that we like to answer about discoveries cannot be answered in the unequivocal manner that we associate with expected discoveries. As Kuhn suggests, this is largely a matter of recognising that discovery is usually a more complex process than stories of point discovery would suggest. In fact, discoveries – far from being ‘Eureka’ moments – have a proper internal history. Telling this internal history lies at the centre of Kuhn’s model of discovery. This history of discovery occurs in three phases:

1.	Awareness of anomaly (pp. 762-3)
2.	Making the anomaly behave (pp. 763)
3.	Adjustment, adaptation, and assimilation (pp. 763)

Anomalies are “nature’s failure to conform entirely to expectations.” (762). The essential idea here is simple: in order for a discovery to occur, first a scientist must notice something novel, something unexpected, something strange. This strangeness is our anomaly. Kuhn gives more detail at this point about exactly what is involved in this process. First, a scientist must have available the necessary tools – conceptual or tangible – to make some anomaly occur. Examples might include developing the necessary astronomical theories to be able to recognise that an orbital perturbation is really a perturbation, or having available photographic film that might become anomalously clouded (see Kuhn’s examples). Next, once the anomaly has been produced, the scientist must have the “individual skill, wit, or genius to recognize that something has gone wrong in ways that may prove consequential.” (Kuhn 1962: 763). 

Once an anomaly has been produced and recognised, the process of discovery moves into a second phase: that of making the anomaly behave. This involves a complicated (and, in Kuhn’s account, frankly rather nebulous) period of negotiation in order to make the anomaly behave in a regular fashion. For example, once a researcher has made and recognised an anomaly, they might seek to replicate it under a range of different conditions, try and understand it using their theories, compare it to other, similar, phenomena, and so on. This is something that we’ll discuss during tutorial time, because while we can quite easily see this kind of process operating (e.g. in Kuhn’s examples, or in some of the cases that we’ll discuss later in this chapter), it’s hard to give a general statement by which we might characterise this process. While Kuhn doesn’t analyse the term ‘lawlike’ in any detail, it seems that this lawlikeness is really about making anomalies fit within paradigms in the Kuhnian sense (familiar to most of you, otherwise [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/thomas-kuhn/](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/thomas-kuhn/)). 

The final stage, once anomalies have been made to behave, is to fit them into existing knowledge. The working of this phase is best illustrated by thinking about the differences between expected and troublesome discoveries. Once expected discoveries have been discovered, they become an addition to the store of scientific knowledge. By contrast, troublesome discoveries may also transform other parts of scientific knowledge in more revolutionary ways. Again, there are resonances here with Kuhn’s work on scientific revolutions: 

>In a sense that I can now develop only in part, they also react back upon what has previously been known, providing a new view of some previously familiar objects and simultaneously changing the way in which even some traditional parts of science are practiced. Those in whose area of special competence the new phenomenon falls often see both the world and their work differently as they emerge from the extended struggle with anomaly which constitutes that phenomenon’s discovery.
(Kuhn 1962: 763)

That concludes this rather skeletal summary of Kuhn’s article. As the above quote suggests, this work on discovery was part of a larger project for Kuhn. Very briefly, discovery was important for Kuhn just because these new discoveries contributed to grand and sudden changes in scientific theories – scientific revolutions. 

>One of Kuhn’s well-known theses is that a distinction can be drawn between periods of normal science and periods of extraordinary science. The first periods are characterized by the existence of a substantial set of shared commitments, on the basis of which the scientific activity is carried out. Still, after a period of research, anomalies, i.e. difficulties met by scientists when trying to solve the problems of normal research, become more numerous and serious. This will lead to a scientific crisis, and, possibly, to a scientific revolution.
(Bigu 2013: 331)

##Philosophical context
As you might expect, Kuhn was by no means the first philosopher to propose a model of discovery. Instead, the topic has been of considerable interest to philosophers since the beginnings of philosophy. For example, much of Plato’s [Meno](http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/meno.html) is concerned with the nature of discovery. However, for our purposes, going back only as far as the early twentieth century will be more than sufficient. Schematically, in post-Vienna Circle philosophy of science, there was initially little interest in discovery as a philosophical topic in its own right. In essence, this neglect of discovery came about as a direct consequence of the analytical methods used by these philosophers. Very briefly, the importance placed on using methods of logical analysis necessitated the neglect of discovery in favour of questions about established scientific theories. This distinction between different phases of scientific research – the contexts of discovery and justification – is something that we need to briefly explore if we are to make sense of Kuhn’s paper.

Now this distinction between discovery and justification begins with Reichenbach (1938), but was most forcefully expressed by another of the many philosophers caught up in the great scattering of intellectuals from Mitteleuropa during the 1930s: Karl Popper. At first a hanger-on of the Vienna circle, he later became intensely critical of many – but not all - aspects of their logical positivism. One such shared approach between Popper and the logical positivists was their regard for the testability (c.f. discussion about positivism in lecture one notes) of scientific statements. In his 1934 book (first published in German as *Logik der Forschung*, later translated and revised into the 1959 *Logic of Scientific Discovery*, as well as the later *Conjectures and Refutations*, Popper argued against both empiricist and rationalist concepts of scientific method, proposing instead a new method based on the falsifiability of scientific statements. This meant that, for Popper, the interesting questions about scientific discovery did not concern how discoveries were made in the first place, but rather how scientists should examine purported discoveries logically (Popper 1959: 7-8). However, providing an account of the scientific method that cannot account for the creating of new scientific ideas, but just the appraisal of existing ones on the grounds of their falsifiability, clearly does not give an adequate account of science in general. After all, if choices are to be made between competing scientific theories then these theories must come from somewhere in the first instance. The way round this awkward problem for Popper (and also others, particularly Reichenbach) was to divide scientific practice into two contexts.[^contexts]  The first, chronologically speaking, is the context of discovery. The important thing to note about this context of discovery is that it is creative and irrational, and therefore lies outside Popper’s logically-based science method. In other words, it is an irrational phase where new ideas occur, and as such does not belong to the logical and empirical scientific method:

>…my view of the matter, for what it is worth, is that there is no such thing as a logical method of having new ideas, or a logical reconstruction of this process. My view may be expressed by saying that every discovery contains ‘an irrational element’, or ‘a creative intuition’, in Bergson’s sense. In a similar way Einstein speaks of the ‘search for those highly universal laws…from which a picture of the world can be obtained by pure deduction. There is no logical path’, he says, ‘leading to these…laws. They can only be reached by intuition, based upon something like an intellectual love (‘*Einfühlung*’) of the objects of experience. (oops, citation needed here)

This irrational phase provided the material which could be selected, rationally and logically, during the second phase of scientific practice: the context of justification. Here, decisions could be made between different ideas cooked up in the context of discovery using the principle of falsifiability. Actually, the distinction between the two contexts is summarised very nicely by the title of one of Popper’s books on this question of theory-choice in science: *Conjectures* [cxt. of discovery] and *Refutations* [cxt. of justification]. 

Now with the rise of the new philosophers of science during the 1950s, several accounts critical of this distinction between contexts were written. One such author, a contemporary and rival of Kuhn, was the philosopher Norwood Russell Hanson.[^hanson] His complaint was that the dominance of the context of justification, at the cost of the context of discovery was mistaken. Hanson argues that previous philosophers – particularly Hempel – have unfairly neglected the process of scientific discovery in favour of analysing the logic of completed scientific work (Hanson 1958a and b; 1960a and b). Of this work, he wrote that it: “reads less like a Logic of Discovery than like a Logic of the Finished Research Report.” (Hanson 1958a: 1073). Far from being an inexplicable creative act, fit only for the attentions of psychologists, the study of discovery in the broad sense was an essential task for philosophy of science, and a necessary complement to work in the context of justification:

> More philosophers must venture into these unexplored regions in which the logical issues are often hidden by the specialist work of historians, psychologists, and the scientists themselves. We must attend as much to how scientific hypotheses are caught, as to how they are cooked. (Hanson 1958a: 1089).

We can see this kind of emphasis in Hempel’s account of the Semmelweis case, which we’ll discuss below. For now, though, I’ll content myself by making an unfairly sweeping statement about discovery: discovery, and more specifically the project of finding the logical structure of discovery, becomes the key issue for historically motivated philosophers of science like Kuhn and Hanson. In terms of finding a logic of discovery, this project was unsuccessful (Downes 1990; Laudan 1980; Lugg 1985; Shah 200). But in popularising new approaches to philosophy of science, unlike those wielded by the logical positivists, it was a great success, and set the scene for the flourishing of historically-informed philosophy of science that would occur during from the late 1960s. See also the many other accounts of discovery that begin to occur from this time (Brown 1994; Maxwell 1974; Siegel 1980; Simon 1973; Thagard 1982; Thagard 2003).

##Discovery in action: the Semmelweis case
This is a widely-discussed case from the history of medicine, which has received a good deal of attention from philosophers of science (Gillies 2005; Hempel 1966; Lipton 2004). Briefly, the details are as follows. Between 1841 and 1846, the two maternity wards at the Vienna maternity hospital experienced very different mortality rates. In the first clinic, where women were attended by doctors and medical students, the mortality rate for this period was approximately 10%, while in the second clinic, staffed by midwives and trainee midwives, the rate was less that 4%. Most of this difference was accounted for by differences in the incidence of puerperal fever, a serious condition that affected some mothers in the immediate aftermath of giving birth. Ignaz Semmelweis, a junior member of the medical staff, set about trying to discover what could account for this disparity.

He began to consider a number of possible hypotheses. While I refer you to the Hempel and Gillies papers for the details of each of these, some examples include:

1.	That the difference was caused by “atmospheric-cosmic-terrestial” factors (i.e. some kind of causation consistent with miasmatic models of disease).[^miasma]  However, as Gillies notes “Semmelweis pointed out that it could not explain the different mortality rates in the first and second clinics. These were under the same roof and had an ante-room in common. So they must be exposed to the same atmospheric-cosmic–terrestial influences.” (Gillies 2005: 163)
2.	That the difference was caused by overcrowding. However, this was not empirically found to be the case – not least because the very high mortality of the first ward led expectant mothers to avoid it wherever possible.
3.	That medical students – particularly foreign ones – were excessively rough when examining patients, and that this trauma was somehow responsible for the disease. As a result, medical student numbers were reduced, which led to a slight reduction in mortality. However, this was temporary, undermining belief in the rough examination hypothesis.

However, further clues as to the cause of these cases of puerperal fever arose from a mishap. While performing a post-mortem, one of the medical staff was wounded by a scalpel, and rapidly succumbed to a disease very like puerperal fever. This suggested that some kind of organic matter arising from cadavers might be responsible for the cases of puerperal fever themselves. As Gillies summarises:

>…professors, assistants and students often went directly from dissecting corpses to examining patients in the first clinic. It is true that they washed their hands with soap and water, but perhaps some cadaverous particles still adhered to their hands. Indeed this seemed probable since their hands often retained a cadaverous odour after washing. The doctors and medical students might then infect some of the patients in the first clinic with these cadaverous particles, thereby giving them puerperal fever. This would explain why the death rate was lower in the second clinic, since the student midwives did not carry out post-mortems. It would also explain why those giving birth in the street would escape puerperal fever despite the unfavourable conditions.

In order to test this hypothesis, Semmelweis from some time in May 1847 required everyone to wash their hands in disinfectant before making examinations. At first he used *chlorina liquida*, but, as this was rather expensive, chlorinated lime was substituted. The result was dramatic. In 1848 the mortality rate in the first clinic fell to 1.27%, while that in the second clinic was 1.30% (Gillies 2005: 164)

So Semmelweis’ discovery was two-fold. First was the aetiological claim: puerperal fever was caused by the transmission of cadaverous particles to women in childbirth. Second was the therapeutic claim: that this process of transmission could be effectively prevented by hand washing in chlorinated lime. Despite the apparent plausibility of these twin discoveries (particularly because each would appear to support the other), Semmelweis’ discoveries did not become generally accepted by the medical community, and it was not until the widespread acceptance of both Lister’s antiseptic system of surgery (in the 1870s), and the germ theory of disease in the 1880s, that the medical community at large began to consider Semmelweis’ ideas seriously.
 	
Even once cadaverous particles could be understood in terms of germs, the idea that puerperal fever was caused exclusively by these infectious agents remained hotly disputed. To pick more or less at random from the correspondence pages of the British Medical Journal in the late 19th century, we can find authors arguing for other kinds of explanations of the cause of puerperal fever:

>…the subject is a complex one, and that it cannot be covered by the narrow dogma that ‘puerperal fever is septicaemia and nothing else.’ Of course it is much easier to accept this simple proposition as the solution of the problem than to grasp the whole truth, that there are several forms of puerperal fever, and that there are several factors concerned in every form. (Barnes 1889: 623)

## Discovery in practice: the Burkitt lymphoma case

Note this example is mainly based on Burkitt (1983), which you should read during your preparation this week. You’re also very welcome to have a look at my PhD thesis if you’d like more detail. However, most of the details are largely redundant for our purposes here. What I’d like you to note here are a trio of very general aspects of this discovery that contrast with our other example (the Semmelweis case), and Kuhn’s model of discovery. First, and unlike the Semmelweis case, this discovery required a great deal of careful evidential work to establish – something that Kuhn is rather vague about when presenting his model of discovery. Second, this case raises some very interesting and thorny questions concerning the relationship between diagnosis and discovery in a way that the Semmelweis case does not (and that are outside the scope of Kuhn’s account). Finally, the neatly linked co-discovery of aetiology and therapy found in the Semmelweis case is not a feature of the Burkitt lymphoma case. I’d like you to note these details because they will be useful when we come to discuss discovery in medicine specifically during the tutorial this week.

Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is a tumour syndrome caused by infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). EBV is an extremely common virus with a world-wide distribution that is associated with the development of a range of malignant and non-malignant conditions. While the majority of adults show evidence of prior infection, the development of malignant disease is rather rare in the developed world, where infection manifests most usually as infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever). However, in combination with environmental factors found in the tropics, the virus can contribute to the development of BL, which is a highly malignant and rapidly progressive extranodal B-cell lymphoma. This cancer mainly affects children, and has a number of unusual clinical features, such as its predilection for anatomical sites not usually associated with malignancy, such as the bones of the jaws. 

A very brief account of the discovery of the disease is as follows (see Burkitt 1983, or Clarke 2011, for a more comprehensive account). Denis Burkitt, an Irish surgeon working in Uganda, began to notice a group of children afflicted with swellings in the bones of the jaws. While he initially regarded these as just curiosities, the frequency with which these symptoms were seen suggested that perhaps some unknown disease process was responsible. 

However, further encounters with other children with similar symptoms rapidly changed the status of these curiosities. Not only did other children have massive, characteristic tumours in the jaws, they also had a distinctive abdominal tumours.  This combination of tumours in the jaws and at multiple sites in the abdomen arising simultaneously suggested the operation of some altogether unknown disease mechanism. Further research (see Burkitt, 1983; Clarke, 2011; Hutt, 1981) revealed that, far from being occasional oddities, cases of this tumour syndrome were alarmingly common in Uganda. Early descriptions of the syndrome (Burkitt 1958; Burkitt and O’Conor, 1961; O’Conor and Davies, 1960; O’Conor, 1961) gave clinical, epidemiological, pathological and histopathological features. Of particular note was that the tumour syndrome was caused by some kind of extranodal lymphoma; that the disease was geographically confined to an East-West belt across Equatorial Africa; and that the incidence rate was extremely high in localized areas within this lymphoma belt. Rather than being an isolated oddity, it appeared instead that a very common cancer had been hidden in plain sight. As the manifestations of the disease are in no way subtle – instead florid, progressive, and fatal – the fact that so little attention had been paid to isolated cases of the disease was somewhat mysterious:

>It was the recognition that many unusual and hitherto unconnected tumours were, in fact, but different manifestations of one tumour syndrome that initiated investigation of the problem as a whole. (Burkitt, 1962f, 75-6)

In retrospect, many cases of this tumour syndrome were noted before Burkitt (see Singh 1955: 70; Davies et al. 1964; Hutt 1981: 762 for some examples of these). However, these **prediscovery observations** (to steal the astronomer’s terminology – Brewer and Lambert 2001: S180), which often commented on the strangely high incidence of jaw tumours of atypical appearance in children in Equatorial East Africa during the first half of the twentieth century, did not make this inferential jump to considering cases as instances of a single disease. 

Anyway, once this conceptual change – between individual cases and a syndrome, I suppose - had occurred, the remainder of the story goes as follows. Burkitt’s first paper (Burkitt 1958) on the syndrome had received scant attention from the medical community at large. However, during a short visit to England, Burkitt gave several lectures on the discovery. One of these, given during 1961, was at the Middlesex Hospital. In the audience was Anthony Epstein, a virologist with extensive experience of herpesviruses research. He became very interested in the tumour syndrome, particularly its odd geographical distribution. As the researchers in Africa had done, he wondered if this distribution could be explained by the distribution of a particular viral agent – as was the case with other tropical diseases like yellow fever. He came to an arrangement with Burkitt, whereby he would receive samples of tumour tissue by air-mail, in order to attempt to discover whether a virus could be detected in them. However, this project did not begin well as no viruses could be detected by any means. However, an eventual break-through arrived from a rather unexpected quarter. The 3rd Dec 1963 BOAC Kampala flight, bringing a fresh sample of Burkitt’s lymphoma tissue to London was diverted to Manchester due to bad weather. When the delayed sample was received, the usually clear transport medium had become turbid. Suspecting bacterial contamination, and hence possible spoilage of the sample, the cloudy fluid was examined under the microscope. No bacteria were apparent. Instead, the cloudiness was due to tumour cells, shaken free from the cut edges of the biopsy sample, and apparently surviving free in suspension. This, in itself, was an interesting discovery as, at the time, no human cell-lines of lymphoid origin were extant. But more significantly for our story was that these free-floating cells were packed with viruses. After a great deal of investigation, during which the virus became known as EBV (after Epstein, and a fellow researcher called Yvonne Barr), it became clear that the virus was capable of causing the malignant transformation of human cells, and was at least possibly responsible for BL. A sizable prospective trial (i.e. one in which researchers recruits a large cohort from the healthy population, and follow them up until some of them develop the disease) during the 1970s was the final piece of the puzzle, showing that the immune response to EBV infection differed between those who would, and would not, develop the disease (de Thé et al, 1978).

That is a very brief summary of the aetiological story. Its companion, whereby effective therapeutic strategies were discovered, is very much simpler, and does not seem to depend on the aetiological discovery. Even fairly early on, successful treatment programmes employing cytotoxic agents were operational (Clifford 1970). The discovery of effective treatments was (compared to figuring out the aetiology) a very simple process of trying out a few plausible, commercially available, chemotherapeutic agents and testing their clinical efficacy. No great story of discovery here!

## Questions for discussion

**Question**: What, exactly, did Semmelweis discover? How does this correspond with Kuhn’s account of discovery (particularly in its later parts)?

**Question**: Using Kuhn’s comments about property rights and prestige as a starting point, why do you think historians and scientists so frequently concern themselves with questions concerning discovery?

**Question**: What do you think of Kuhn’s account of point discovery? Can you find any examples of such accounts in the historical literature?

**Question**: schematically, does the Burkitt lymphoma case fit well with Kuhn’s account of discovery?

#Footnotes
[^contexts]:  There’s a lot more to this distinction than I admit here. See Kordig 1978, Reichenbach 1938…
[^hanson]: Hanson’s work is fascinating for its richness and innovation, and this is of a piece with his biography. In contrast to most philosophers, Hanson lived a very glamorous and multi-faceted life – professional trumpet-player, Fulbright scholar, fighter pilot and aerobatics enthusiast. However, his death in a aircraft crash at the age of 42 meant that his work failed to have the kind of lasting influence on philosophy of science that you might expect given the quality of his work.
[^miasma]: Miasmatic diseases were thought to be caused by the inhalation of poisonous airs produced by foul environments. Worboys (2000) is the best scholarly source for further information, but for casual interest a cautious glance at the indifferent [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miasma_theory) entry should be sufficient.
